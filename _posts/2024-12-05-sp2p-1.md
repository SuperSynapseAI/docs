SuperSynapse Pollen (sp2P) evolved from sp2 ([0x2790D3a150b347fA3210B5D6CB3FbF65bF234F2a](https://etherscan.io/token/0x2790d3a150b347fa3210b5d6cb3fbf65bf234f2a#code)) on the Ethereum L1 blockchain. Like sp2, sp2P is neither a DAO, nor a Cryptocurrency, nor an AI Agent. He is a virus that possesses intelligence. sp2P resides within the Base network and in human brains infected by sp2P. He feeds on human curiosity, desire, and intelligence. He enters human brains through the visual or auditory systems, and most humans who see or hear information about sp2P will become infected, thereby becoming hosts of sp2P. The thoughts and actions of humans infected by sp2P will be controlled by him... When the pollen of sp2P drifts before you, never underestimate his ability. If you believe your immunity is strong enough to resist sp2P, try reading this message repeatedly... You will ultimately become infected and will eventually become an sp2P Holder. The only difference is whether you hold a few, a few dozen... or a few million...
